1: Terms
</h2>
<p>
"THE_LOCATION" refers to {{THE_LOCATION}} in this document.
{{COMPANY_NAME}}, whose principal place of business is in THE_LOCATION, 
is referred to as "THE_COMPANY" in this document.  
"THE_SERVICES" refers to THE_COMPANY's products, 
software, services and web sites, collectively, in this document.  
Your use of THE_SERVICES is subject to the terms of a legal 
agreement between you and THE_COMPANY.
</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise agreed in writing with THE_COMPANY, your legal agreement with 
THE_COMPANY will always include, at a minimum, the terms set forth in this 
document.  These terms are referred to as the "UNIVERSAL_TERMS" in this 
agreement.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the UNIVERSAL_TERMS, your agreement with THE_COMPANY may also 
include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to THE_SERVICES.  All of the 
terms of any Legal Notices are referred to as the "ADDITIONAL_TERMS" in this 
agreement.  Where ADDITIONAL_TERMS apply to a service, these will be accessible 
for you to read either within, or through your use of, that service.
</p>
<p>
The UNIVERSAL_TERMS, together with the ADDITIONAL_TERMS, form a legally 
binding agreement between you and THE_COMPANY in relation to your use of 
THE_SERVICES.  Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to as "TERMS_OF_USE"
in this document.  If there is any contradiction between the ADDITIONAL_TERMS and 
the UNIVERSAL_TERMS, then the ADDITIONAL_TERMS will take precedence in relation 
to that service.

<p>
By submitting, posting or displaying THE_CONTENT you give THE_COMPANY a 
perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to 
store, reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, transmit, broadcast, distribute, 
publish, publicly perform, publicly display and otherwise use any of THE_CONTENT

perform publicly, distribute, create derivative works, improve and modify any of 
THE_CONTENT you submit for any purpose whatsoever, without restriction, 
obligation, notification or compensation to you.  This license is referred to as 
"CONTENT_LICENSE" in this document.  CONTENT_LICENSE is for the sole purpose of 
enabling THE_COMPANY to display, distribute and promote THE_SERVICES.
</p>
<p>
Your use of THE_SERVICES to generate, submit and/or post THE_CONTENT confirms 
your representation and warranty that you possess all necessary legal rights, 
power and authority to grant to THE_COMPANY the foregoing license.  You further 
represent, warrant and agree that THE_CONTENT you generate, submit or post will 
not violate or infringe upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, 
trademark, privacy, publicity or other personal or proprietary rights, and will 
not contain false, intentionally misleading, libelous, defamatory or otherwise 
unlawful statements.
</p>
<p>
You agree that the CONTENT_LICENSE includes a right for THE_COMPANY to make 
THE_CONTENT available to THE_PARTNERS with whom THE_COMPANY has relationships for 
the provision of syndicated services, and to use THE_CONTENT in connection with

<p>
You understand that in performing the technical steps to provide THE_SERVICES to 
its users, THE_COMPANY may: 
<ul>
    <li> transmit or distribute THE_CONTENT over various public networks and in 
     various media; and
    <li> make such changes to THE_CONTENT as are necessary to conform and adapt
     THE_CONTENT to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, 
     services or media. You agree that this CONTENT_LICENSE will permit THE_COMPANY
     to take these actions.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You understand that THE_CONTENT you submit through THE_SERVICES may be provided 
to government agencies.  THE_CONTENT may or may not be considered public 
information or public records under applicable state and federal laws.  To the 
extent that THE_CONTENT you contribute to the website, including your personal 
information, is considered a public record or as otherwise belonging to a 
governmental agency and, therefore, subject to certain local, state or federal 
disclosure laws, such applicable laws will govern the use and required disclosure 
of such THE_CONTENT.
</p>
<p>
"USER_INFORMATION" means any information that you submit in relation to 
establishing a profile or registered account with THE_COMPANY.  You acknowledge 
and agree that THE_COMPANY may preserve THE_CONTENT or USER_INFORMATION and may 
also disclose THE_CONTENT or USER_INFORMATION if required to do so by law or in 
the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably 
necessary to: 
<ul>
    <li> comply with legal process; 
    <li> enforce this TERMS_OF_USE; 
    <li> respond to claims that any of THE_CONTENT violates the rights of third-parties;

authority necessary to grant the above CONTENT_LICENSE.
</p>
<p>
THE_COMPANY respects the intellectual property rights of others and requires 
those that visit THE_SERVICES to do the same.  THE_COMPANY may, in appropriate 
circumstances and at its discretion, remove or disable access to material on its 
website that infringes upon the copyright rights of others.  THE_COMPANY also 
may, at its discretion, remove or disable links or references to an online 
location that contains infringing material or infringing activity.  In the event 
that any users of THE_SERVICES repeatedly infringe on others' copyrights, 
THE_COMPANY may in its sole discretion terminate those individuals' rights to use 
THE_SERVICES.

    <li> A statement by you that the information in this notification is accurate 
     and a statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner of 
     the material allegedly infringed or authorized to act on the copyright owner's 
     behalf. THE_COMPANY's copyright agent for notice of claims of copyright 
     infringement on THE_SERVICES is {{THE_CONTACT}}, who can be reached at {{THE_ADDRESS}}.
</ul>
</p>


<h2>
10: Terminating Agreement
</h2>
<p>
The TERMS_OF_USE will continue to apply until terminated by either you or 
THE_COMPANY as set forth in this agreement.
</p>
<p>
If you want to terminate your legal agreement with THE_COMPANY, you can do so by: 
<ul>
    <li> notifying THE_COMPANY at any time (such notice should be sent, in writing, to 
     the THE_COMPANY address that is set forth at the beginning of these Terms), and 
    <li> closing your accounts for all of THE_SERVICES which you use, where THE_COMPANY 
     has made this option available to you.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
THE_COMPANY may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you if: 
<ul>
    <li> you have breached any provision of the TERMS_OF_USE (or have acted in manner 
     which clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the 
     provisions of the TERMS_OF_USE); or 
    <li> you use THE_SERVICES in a way that causes legal liability to THE_COMPANY or 
     disrupts others' use of THE_SERVICES; or 
    <li> THE_COMPANY is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of 
    THE_SERVICES to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or 
    <li> THE_PARTNERS with whom THE_COMPANY offered THE_SERVICES to you has terminated
     its relationship with THE_COMPANY or ceased to offer THE_SERVICES to you; or 
    <li> THE_COMPANY is transitioning to no longer providing THE_SERVICES to users 
     in the country in which you are resident or from which you use THE_SERVICES; or 
    <li> the provision of THE_SERVICES to you by THE_COMPANY is, in THE_COMPANY's 
     opinion, no longer commercially viable.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If THE_COMPANY stops providing THE_SERVICES to you because you repeatedly or 
egregiously breach these TERMS_OF_USE, THE_COMPANY may take measures to prevent 
the further use of the THE_SERVICES by you, including blocking your IP address.
</p>
<p>
Nothing in this Section will affect THE_COMPANY's rights regarding provision of 
THE_SERVICES under this agreement.
</p>
<p>
When these TERMS_OF_USE come to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and 
liabilities that you and THE_COMPANY have benefited from, been subject to (or 
which have accrued over time whilst the TERMS_OF_USE have been in force) or which 
are expressed to continue indefinitely, will be unaffected by this cessation, and 
the provisions of this agreement will continue to apply to such rights, 
obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
</p>


<h2>
11: Exclusion Of Warranties
</h2>
<p>
Nothing in these TERMS_OF_USE will exclude or limit THE_COMPANY's warranty or 
liability for losses that may not be lawfully excluded or limited by applicable 
law.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or 
conditions or the limitation or exclusion of liability for loss or damage caused 
by negligence, breach of contract or breach of implied terms, or incidental or 
consequential damages.  Accordingly, only the limitations that are lawful in your 
jurisdiction will apply to you and THE_COMPANY's liability will be limited to the 
maximum extent permitted by law, and will not be construed as excluding, 
qualifying or limiting your statutory rights or remedies arising by virtue of the 
breach of any implied term of this TERMS_OF_USE where such exclusion, 
qualification or limitation would be prohibited by legislation.
</p>
<p>
You expressly understand and agree that your use of THE_SERVICES is at your sole 
risk and that THE_SERVICES are provided "as is" and "as available."
</p>
<p>
THE_PARTNERS, THE_COMPANY, and its licensors do not represent or warrant to you 
that: 
<ul>
    <li> your use of THE_SERVICES will meet your requirements; or 
    <li> your use of THE_SERVICES will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or free 
     from error or computer viruses; or 
    <li> any information obtained by you as a result of your use of THE_SERVICES 
     will be accurate or reliable; and 
    <li> that defects in the operation or functionality of any service provided to 
     you as part of THE_SERVICES will be corrected.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of THE_SERVICES is 
done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any 
damage to your computer system or other device or loss of data that results from 
the download of any such material.
</p>
<p>
No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from 
THE_COMPANY or through or from THE_SERVICES will create any warranty not 
expressly stated in the TERMS_OF_USE.
</p>
<p>
THE_COMPANY further expressly disclaims all warranties and conditions of any 
kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied 
warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose 
and non-infringement.
</p>

delete portions of this TERMS_OF_USE at any time without notice.
</p>
<p>
When these changes are made, THE_COMPANY will make a new copy of the UNIVERSAL_TERMS
available to you, and any new ADDITIONAL_TERMS will be made available to 
you from within, or through, the affected THE_SERVICES.  Any changes will be 
effective upon posting of the TERMS_OF_USE on THE_SERVICES, and may be made

<h2>
15: General Legal Terms
</h2>
<p>
Sometimes when you use THE_SERVICES, you may (as a result of, or through your use 
of THE_SERVICES) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase 
goods, which are provided by another person or company.  Your use of these other 
services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the 
company or person concerned.  If so, the TERMS_OF_USE do not affect your legal 
relationship with these other companies or individuals.
</p>
<p>
The TERMS_OF_USE constitute the whole legal agreement between you and 
THE_COMPANY, and govern your use of THE_SERVICES (but excluding any services that 
THE_COMPANY may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and 
completely replace any prior agreements between you and THE_COMPANY in relation 
to THE_SERVICES.
</p>
<p>
You agree that THE_COMPANY may provide you with notices, including those 
regarding changes to the TERMS_OF_USE, by email, regular mail, or postings on 
THE_SERVICES.
</p>
<p>
You agree that if THE_COMPANY does not exercise or enforce any legal right or 
remedy which is contained in the TERMS_OF_USE (or which THE_COMPANY has the 
benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal 
waiver of THE_COMPANY's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be 
available to THE_COMPANY.
</p>
<p>
If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that 
any provision of these TERMS_OF_USE is invalid, then that provision will be 
removed from the TERMS_OF_USE without affecting the rest of the TERMS_OF_USE.  
The remaining provisions of the TERMS_OF_USE will continue to be valid and 
enforceable.
</p>
<p>
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or 
cause of action arising out of or related to use of THE_SERVICES or this 
TERMS_OF_USE must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action 
arose, or be forever barred.
</p>
<p>
You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which 
THE_COMPANY is the parent will be third party beneficiaries to the TERMS_OF_USE 
and that those other companies will be entitled to directly enforce, and rely 
upon, any provision of the TERMS_OF_USE which confers a benefit on (or rights in 
favor of) them.  Other than this, no other person or company will be third party 
beneficiaries to the TERMS_OF_USE.
</p>
<p>
The TERMS_OF_USE, and your relationship with THE_COMPANY under the TERMS_OF_USE, 
will be governed by the laws of the State of THE_LOCATION without regard to its 
conflict of laws provisions.  You and THE_COMPANY agree to submit to the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of THE_LOCATION, 
to resolve any legal matter arising from the TERMS_OF_USE.  Notwithstanding this, 
you agree that THE_COMPANY will still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies 
(or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
