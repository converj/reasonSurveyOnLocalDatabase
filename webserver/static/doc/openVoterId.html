    <h1> Open voter ID </h1>

    
    <h2> About </h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Open Voter ID was designed to be like OpenID, to allow third-party web-applications to confirm registered voters' city of residence,
            and thereby enable local civic participation without foreign interference.
            Open Voter ID uses scrambled government voter-registration data to confirm a user's name & address & verification data.
            But Open Voter ID does not reveal the user's data to application-websites, 
            except for the user's city & an application-user-id only usable on that application-website.
        </p><p>
            Open Voter ID helps third-party application-websites build services that are specific to the citizens of a city,
            without needing to access nor store sensitive information about each user.
        </p><p>
            Open Voter ID helps users use multiple third-party application-websites providing a variety of civic services, 
            using a single login, while remaining anonymous to the application-websites.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h2> Goals </h2>
    <div>
        <p> When creating Open Voter ID, we had the following goals: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Verify that a user is a registered-voter for a particular locale.
            <li> Allow the user to be verified on multiple application-websites, using a single familiar login-service and account verification.
            <li> Provide a stable user-ID so that application-websites can associate data with that user.
            <li> Do not allow application-websites to know who the user is, nor any other information beyond locale.
            <li> Do not expose voter-registration data to hackers.
        </ul>
        <p> Some of these goals conflict, such as anonymity versus application-websites storing user-activity-records.
    </div>


    <h2> Methods </h2>
    <div>
        <p> To accomplish the goals, Open Voter ID was designed with the following features: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Login-service only stores hashes of user data.
            <ul>
                <li> Voter registration data is converted to user-data-hashes that are uploaded to the login-service.

                <li> <span class=jargon>user data</span> = <span class=term>identity data (name + address)</span> + <span class=term>verification data</term>

                <li> <span class=jargon>verification data</span> may include: 
                    <span class=term>phone</span>, <span class=term>birthdate</span>, <span class=term>social security number</span>, <span class=term>postal-mailed secret code</span>
                <ul>
                    <li style='list-style-type:none;'> Governments that already mail yearly voter documents, 
                        can attach a short user-specific <span class=jargon>secret code</span> to those documents.
                </ul>

                <li> Login-service hit-tests users' login-form submissions against user-identity & user-verification hashes.
                <li> Login-service does not send a session-cookie;  only application-websites may set session-cookies, limiting the impact of session-cookie theft.
            </ul>

            <li> Login-service does not share user-data with application-websites.
            <ul>
                <li> Login-service provides <span class=jargon>application user ID</span> & <span class=jargon>locale</span> to application-websites.
                <ul>
                    <li style='list-style-type:none;'> Application-websites cannot derive the original voter-registration user-data from the application-user-ID.
                    <li style='list-style-type:none;'> Application-user-IDs are specific to each application-website, so that users cannot be tracked across application-websites.
                </ul>

                <li> Application-websites do not share records of user activities with login-service.
            </ul>

            <li> A compromised-device that tampers with votes on application-websites, 
                may be detected by the user comparing their application-website records on a second differently-compromised device.
                <ul>
                    <li style='list-style-type:none;'> This is similar to using a second vote display on paper.
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <h2> Anonymity </h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Protecting user anonymity was one of the most important and difficult goals of the login system. 
            No guarantee is possible, because users can intentionally de-anonymize themselves in their posts.
            However, the login-system should prevent accidental de-anonymization.
            Open Voter ID's methods help protect anonymity, as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Login-service and application-website have to work together to break user anonymity.

            <li> Users' real identity must be known to break anonymity,
                because user-IDs used by login-service and application-website are non-reversible hashes of the real-identity.  

            <li> Tracing from application-activity back to a real-identity is legally difficult, 
                because many real-identities must be probed, searching for a real-identity that hashes to the target application-user-ID.

            <li> Application-websites can make tracing more difficult by re-hashing the application-user-ID with their own secret-salt,
                and storing records keyed by this application-private-user-ID.

            <li> The login-service lacks session-cookies, reducing the chance of tracing user activity across application-websites.
        </ul>
    </div>


    <h2> Sequence of events </h2>
    <p>
        Open Voter ID implemented the described login methods, using the following order of operations.
        All hashes use sha-512, and salt from an OS-specific randomness source.
